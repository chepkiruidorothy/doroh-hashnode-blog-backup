## 5 steps to become a self-taught software engineer

Many people want to be software engineers but lack the financial resources to do so. Returning to college is an option, but it is expensive and takes four years on average. A Bootcamp is another option. While this appears to be a less expensive option than college, it still necessitates some financial resources. The Bootcamp curriculum is brief and intensive, typically lasting three to six months.

You may not have a lot of time if you are looking to transition from another career to coding. Learning programming in your spare time is the best option. The issue with this option is determining where to begin. The road to becoming a self-taught software engineer is not without bumps.

**Steps to being a programmer **

Here are five steps you can take to become a self taught software engineer without a bootcamp or degree.

1. Choose a programming language.
2. Look for learning materials online
3. Practice by doing
4. Online presence
5. Prepare for job interviews

Let's examine each stage in greater detail.

**1.Choose a programming language.**

Do some online research and see what tickles your interest. There are many paths to choose from. Do you want to be a front-end developer? Or perhaps an Android developer? Are you an expert in iOS or data science? What you want to achieve influences the programming language you select. For example, if you want to be a front-end developer, JavaScript is your best bet.
If you haven't decided which path to take, Python is the best place to start. It is the most simple language available. Java, JavaScript, C, and C++ are some other options.
Make an effort to become proficient in whatever you choose.

**2. Look for learning materials online**

Now that you have picked a programming language, what next? There are numerous resources available online, but identifying the most useful ones can be difficult. You don't want to jump from one learning material to the next because the quality is subpar. This can significantly reduce your learning time.
Are you comfortable with videos, blogs, or books? It is entirely up to you which one you prefer. The best place to start is freecodecamp or codecademy. Udemy videos are another viable option.

**3. Practice makes perfect.**

Practice is the best way to remember something. There is nothing wrong with relying on tutorials, but you will only learn so much if you  follow and do not practice. You don't want to be trapped in "tutorial hell." This is where, rather than getting your hands dirty, you rely solely on tutorials.
Try to replicate what you learned on your own after each tutorial. Follow a tutorial to add new features to the program you just created. The sooner you finish tutorials, the better. As you learn, create simple programs.

**4. Online visibility**

A portfolio is the best way to show potential employers what you have learned. It is an online resume that allows you to showcase the projects you have worked on. Get the best projects that you are confident in for your portfolio. Look for ways to network. Is there a programming meetup in your area? You don't want to miss out on that. Can you tweet? Document your journey. Look for hackathons to attend. You have no idea where your future employer might find you. Alternatively, if you want to be a freelancer, putting yourself out there may lead to your next job.
Git is a version control system that allows you to share your code with others. Maintaining a git profile while coding is a good practice because it documents your coding journey. Having your code available raises your visibility to potential employers.

**5.Get ready for job interviews.**

Potential employers and recruiters can assess your problem-solving and coding abilities during a coding interview. The best way to prepare is to use resources like leetcode, which has a large collection of interview questions. You will have plenty of opportunities to practice interview questions. This increases your chances of getting the job.

**Conclusion**

Yes, learning to code is difficult. You will have bad days where you want to quit. Persistence and resilience will eventually pay off. So don't give up; keep going.
